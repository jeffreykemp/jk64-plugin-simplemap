The user can click the map to set a single Marker. You can have the region synchronize the map with an item you nominate - if so, the position where the user clicks will be written to the item as a lat,long pair of coordinates. If the item is loaded with some coordinators, or changed by the user, the map marker will be moved to the indicated position.
